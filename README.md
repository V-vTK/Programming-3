# Programming-3
 University of Oulu course on API + server + database design and implementation. 2024

## Branches ##
Each week's assignments are stored in separate branches.

Starting from week-2, a self-signed certificate is required. Generate it using the following command:

```
keytool -genkey -alias alias -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks -keysize 2048
Ensure that the first and last names are set to 'localhost'.
```
Additionally, for testing purposes, your browser's certificate is needed. You can find it under the padlock icon in Chrome. Export it and add it to the root of the project.
